Risk assessment is the process of identifying, analyzing, and evaluating potential risks that could negatively impact an organization, system, or project. It is a key component of cybersecurity, DevSecOps, and overall risk management strategies.

### **Risk Assessment Process**

1.  **Identify Risks** – Recognizing potential threats and vulnerabilities (e.g., security flaws, compliance risks, operational risks).
2.  **Analyze Risks** – Determining the likelihood and impact of each identified risk.
3.  **Evaluate & Prioritize Risks** – Assessing the severity of risks using frameworks like CVSS, STRIDE, or DREAD.
4.  **Mitigate Risks** – Implementing security controls, patches, or strategies to reduce risk exposure.
5.  **Monitor & Review** – Continuously updating risk assessments as threats evolve.

### **Types of Risk Assessments**

-   **Qualitative Risk Assessment** – Uses descriptive analysis (e.g., high, medium, low risk).
-   **Quantitative Risk Assessment** – Uses numerical values to calculate risk (e.g., Annual Loss Expectancy).
-   **Compliance-Based Risk Assessment** – Ensures alignment with regulatory frameworks like ISO 27001, NIST, or OWASP.

### **Risk Assessment in DevSecOps**

For DevSecOps, risk assessment is crucial in securing the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Some common practices include:

-   **Threat modeling** to identify attack vectors.
-   **SAST & DAST scans** to detect vulnerabilities.
-   **Supply Chain Risk Assessment** using **SCA** tools.
-   **Continuous monitoring** with SIEM solutions.
